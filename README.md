# MWFinal
This repository is Meredith Willmott's final project for ECOL596W

This project uses citizen science data sourced from iNaturalist to identify patterns of diversity in leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) across Arizona. It uses the packages dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot2, rnaturalearth, and sf to model this diversity on a map of Arizona
