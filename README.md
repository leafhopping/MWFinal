# MWFinal
Hi Sabrina :) this was a great assignment. Sorry it took me until the last day to submit- I was actually working on this for my leafhopper presentation to see if I could find any association between specific leafhopper genera and riparian habitats. But that ended up being a nightmare because the leafhoppers associated with riparian areas are incredibly small and incredibly poorly known. That being said, this was a really fun project and I'm actually going to be able to use it! 

This repository is Meredith Willmott's final project for ECOL596W

This project uses citizen science data sourced from iNaturalist to identify patterns of diversity in leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) and true hoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) across Arizona. It uses the packages dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot2, rnaturalearth, vegan, tigris, and sf to model this diversity on a map of Arizona according to different counties. In comparing the diversity for these groups, there was not a significant variance between counties, which I believe can be explained by the relative difficulty of these groups not only to observe but to identify.
